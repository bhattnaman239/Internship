Python Functions
1. Functions as Objects: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.
Passing Functions as Arguments:
Functions can be passed to other functions to execute dynamic behavior.
Returning Functions from Functions:
A function can return another function, often creating closures.

2. Lambda Expressions
Anonymous, single-expression functions defined with the lambda keyword.
map: Applies a function to all elements of an iterable.
filter: Selects elements based on a condition.
reduce: Combines elements into a single result.

3. Decorators
Functions that modify the behavior of other functions, defined with the @decorator syntax.
