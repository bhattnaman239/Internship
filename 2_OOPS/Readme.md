Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

1. Classes and Objects
Class: A blueprint for creating objects with attributes (data) and methods (functions).
Object: An instance of a class.

2. Inheritance
Allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), enabling code reuse.

3. Polymorphism
The ability to use a single interface or method in different forms, depending on the object.

4. Encapsulation
Restricts direct access to certain class attributes, often using private variables (__variable).

5. Abstraction
Focuses on essential features while hiding implementation details, often using abstract base classes.

6. Magic Methods
Special methods surrounded by double underscores (e.g., __init__, __add__), which allow you to customize object behavior.

7. Static and Class Methods
Static Methods: Independent of any instance or class state, defined using @staticmethod.
Class Methods: Operate on the class itself, not instances, defined using @classmethod.
