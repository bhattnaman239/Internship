Python Fundamentals
1. Data Types and Variables: Python supports several data types for variables:
Data Types and Variables
**Numeric Types: Python supports int (integer), float (decimal numbers), and complex (numbers with real and imaginary parts).
Strings: A sequence of characters. Strings can be manipulated using built-in methods such as .lower(), .upper(), .replace(), etc.
Lists: Mutable collections of elements, indexed and ordered (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
Tuples: Immutable collections of elements (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).
Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs for mapping data (e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}).
Type Conversion and Casting: Converting between data types, such as int to str or float to int.

**Control Flow
Conditional Statements: Using if, elif, and else to execute different code paths based on conditions.
Loops: Iterating over sequences or conditions using for and while loops.
Iterable: An object capable of returning its elements one at a time (e.g., lists, strings).
Iterator: An object that tracks its position in a sequence and returns elements using next().
break: Terminates the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.
else: Executes after the loop finishes normally (not interrupted by break)

**Functions
Defining Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code defined with def.
Arguments: Functions can accept arguments that can be positional, keyword, default, or arbitrary (*args, **kwargs).
Returning Values: Functions return results using the return keyword.
Variable Scope: Variables can be local (inside functions) or global (accessible everywhere).
Lambda Functions: Anonymous functions for simple, one-line expressions.
